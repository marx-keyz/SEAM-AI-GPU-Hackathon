### SEAM-AI-GPU-Hackathon

This repository contains the Rocky-AI teams first place Test 2 and third place Test 1 solution to the Parihaka Seismic Facies Identification Challenge in the SEAM/NVIDIA Applied Geoscience GPU Hackathon. The goal was a six-way classification of the Parihaka 3D seismic survey, with emphasis on interface and key facies. The U-Net architecture of the EfficientNet-B0 pretrained network with Pytorch was used which achieved 95% test accuracy the validation test.
